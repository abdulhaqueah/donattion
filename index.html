          Floods paralysing Sylhet. Around 13 lakh people were affected in
          Sylhet city, including five Upazilas. As a part of the emergency
          response, we distribute food among the people in the flood-affected
          area. Every day, we plan to distribute cooked food and water
          purification tablets. So, please come forward and support them with
          relief.

            If a donor mistypes their email address when making an online
            donation, it will result in inaccurate records for you and no tax
            receipt for your donor - so sad! Luckily, you can easily correct
            this mistake right from your Fundraising Pages admin account.
